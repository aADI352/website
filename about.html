                            My passion for engineering - especially aerospace - started when I was very little; I would spend most of my day in front of the TV 
                            watching series and documentaries about aeroplanes, automobiles and large machinery on national geographic and youtube.<br>
                            <br>
                            In 2018 I attended an aerospace camp at the technion where I had the chance to learn about aerodynamics and rocket propulsion. The highlight was testing our model
                            aeroplane in a wind tunnel, which only contributed to my love for the field. Inspired,
                            a friend and I created a course for younger students with an aim to promote aerospace engineering - an otherwise
                            unpopular field in my area due to the political context.<br><br> During the COVID pandemic, I launched an
                            aviation group on <i>Discord</i> which drew in more than 600 members from all around the world.<br>
                            <br>
                            in 2019 I joined a local <i><b>FIRST robotics competition</b></i> team, where I became a part of the CAD subteam - helping design our robots 
                            using <i>solidworks</i>, while learning all about electronics and gathering experince in 
                            fabrication - mainly 3D printing and CNC milling. 8 years later I continue with the team as a CAD mentor! 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            While at the <i><b>"NIR School of the Heart" </b></i>- a programme run by the Harvard-MIT biomedical engineering
                            lab and Medinol I worked on various team projects. for example, finding a minimally invasive way of treating an aneurysm and
                             presenting it to leading pioneers in the field. It was a shift, experiencing a new and vastly different - but 
                             equally impressive- field of engineering. 
                             <br><br>
                             I knew I wanted to study some form of engineering at university. To this end, I studied Maths, Physics, Computer science 
                             and mechatronics at 5 units. My bagrut average was 119/119. <br>
                             <br>
                             The hard work paid off when I was accepted to study aerospace engineering at Technion - Israel institute of technology. I am looking forward for this upcoming journey, continuing to grow as a person.
                              <br><br>
                                My life goal to join and contribute to the Aerospace industry, for I hold immense amounts of passion towards this field.
